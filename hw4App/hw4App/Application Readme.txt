The fourth and last assignment of the course had no specific subject and the scope was for us to create a responsive website using all the knowledge we accumulated during the said course. For my assignment i chose to recreate/mimic the famous online food delivery site of greece.

My site had two different signup pages one for customers who wanted to use the webapp for ordering online, and one for the store owners who would create their profile add their menus, prices, photos, location, distance radius of delivery etc.

In this webapp i also used Google API's to find the distance between the qustomer's picked location and all the possible stores in his greek municipality in order to filter only the ones who would most likely be able to serve him.

As a second step before showing the available stores I added the factor of distance radius that each of those stores had put in their profiles, so when the qustomer lands in the page with the available stores in his region, all of those stores will for sure be able to serve him.
